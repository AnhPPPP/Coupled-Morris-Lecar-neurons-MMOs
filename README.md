### Code File Overview
#### MATLAB codes
* [CML_ode.m](CML_ode.m): consists of full model ODEs.
* [w2_v2_v1_projection.m](w2_v2_v1_projection.m): generates the projections of the solution trajectory, fold surfaces, superslow manifold, and folded singularity curves onto $(w_2, V_2, V_1)$-space.

#### XPP codes
* [CML_fold_curve.txt](CML_fold_curve.txt): extracts fold curve data.
* [CML_superslow_manifold.txt](CML_superslow_manifold.txt): extracts superslow manifold data.
